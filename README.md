# CSS-basics-indian-flag
The CSS mode used in the file is inline, as very basic CSS comes in handy to make the flag.
This is one of the CSS basic projects. It's been made while learning the web development course. 
Firstly the PNG image of "ashok-chakra" was used.
After which, when I got to know somewhat about SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics), then to make the index.html file of our project completely independent of any media source, I decided to use a SVG(or simply call it an icon) in my CSS code. 
This update keeps the whole file in a code format hence making it more independent.
Update at: 8:50PM 05-06-2023, SVG Applied to the project. The code for "ashok-chakra" was taken from a website and used in it to replace the <img>.
What is SVG? 
SVG, in very simple terms, is created using XML language format and basically uses code to create graphics/icons(as the name suggests). Using and applying CSS to it is more important, in my opinion, rather than actually being able to create a SVG as there are loads of internet sources for that!!
