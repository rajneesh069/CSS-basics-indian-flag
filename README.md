# CSS-basics-indian-flag
This is one of the CSS basic projects. It's been made while learning the web development course. I haven't learned SVG at least yet, so for the ashok-chakra I've used a PNG image. 
Update at: 8:50PM 05-06-2023, SVG Applied to the project. The code for "ashok-chakra" was taken from a website and used in it to replace the <img>.
